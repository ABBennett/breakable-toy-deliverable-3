Incorporate the feedback you got from your mentor on your ER diagrams, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Submit a new version that has taken that feedback into account. This *will* be graded, so please make sure to do a good job!

**Please also attach a short description of your Breakable Toy.** This assignment may very well be graded by someone who is not your mentor, so please make sure to include all the information necessary to make it readable by someone with no prior context on your app.

Please, submit this by the end of Week 8.
