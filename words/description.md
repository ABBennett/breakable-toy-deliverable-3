My breakable toy will be a chat app, where users can connect to other users and chat in real time. Users will be able to rate the other user's conversation skills. Users can also pick chatrooms based on different topics. There will be requirements for certain chatrooms, so only users with a certain rating can enter certain chat rooms. Users can get badges for doing certain things. For example, a user would get a badge if they rated 100 users, or had a rating over 4.
